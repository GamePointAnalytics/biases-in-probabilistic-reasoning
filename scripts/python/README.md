This folder contains the core Python code for analysis and modeling.

## Files

### 1. `Tennis_Analytics.ipynb`
**Description**: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing tennis match data.
**Key Features**:
This program loads professional tennis match data from tennisabstract.com, cleans the data, and calculates the win probability for all possible game-score and point-score combinations. For example: what is the game win rate for player 1 if the point score is 15–40? What’s the set win rate for player 1 if the game score is 3–4? The goal is to provide empirical win rates for different score combinations and compare them with the win rates generated by a theoretical model.

### 2. `tennis_probabilities.py`
**Description**: A Python implementation of the Tennis Win Probability Model.
**Key Features**:
This program calculates a player's game and set winning probabilities for different game and point score combinations, based on the player's service and return point winning probability. This method is commonly used to predict the game and set winner in online sports betting. The win probability data generated from this model will be compared with the empirical win probability data calculated from the pro tennis match data. The goal is to check if the model makes accurate prediction.

## Usage
- **Notebook**: Open `Tennis_Analytics.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Lab. Ensure your kernel is set to the correct Python environment.
- **Script**: Run `python tennis_probabilities.py` to see sample probability outputs for different score scenarios.
